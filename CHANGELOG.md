# Changes from the 0.1 series

## Breaking changes

All potential and pseudopotential functionality has been removed from this package and will be 
placed in a new package, `DFTPotentials.jl`.

## Organizational changes

The `data.jl` file will be split into multiple files within the `src/data` directory. (This has
caused some of the file history to be lost to Git)
