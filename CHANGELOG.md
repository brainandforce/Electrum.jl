## [0.1.2]: 2023-06-26

### Added
 -  `partial_derivative()`, `gradient()`, and `directional_derivative()` functions for real space
data
 -  `Electrum.SUnitVector{D,T}` data type for generating unit vectors. A unit vector of dimension
`D` and type `T` can be constructed with the unit at index `i` with `Electrum.SUnitVector{D,T}(i)`,
provided `oneunit(T)` is defined.

## [0.1.1] - 2023-06-21

### Changed
 -  Unexported methods for reading anaddb inputs/outputs now have more standard signatures

### Fixed
 -  `voxelsize(::DataGrid)` now correctly uses the grid length, not the basis vector length
 -  `lengths(::LatticeBasis)` now correctly uses a column iterator to return the length values

## [0.1.0] - 2023-05-25

Initial release of Electrum.jl
