# Introduction

Xtal.jl is a package designed to make the development of chemical theory tools easier. Not only 
does it offer a type system that handles data commonly used in theory (such as real and reciprocal
space data grids), it also offers broad support for filetypes common to chemical theory.

In the future, we aim to support native Julia plotting of data processed by this package with a 
separate package.
