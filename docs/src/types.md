# Types

Electrum.jl provides a rich type system for handling a variety of data that may arise in 
computational work with periodic structures. Many of these types are generic enough to handle cases
of crystals in arbitrary dimension, which may be useful for theoretical work or for handling
complicated real-world cases, such as incommensurately modulated crystals.

# Datasets

Electrum.jl supports a good number of different data types, including:
  * Real space datagrids
  * Reciprocal space data by HKL index
  * Band structures and densities of states
  * k-point lists and grids
  * Data by atomic position
  * Spherical harmonic coefficients

## Data traits

Electrum.jl uses a trait system to classify its types that are used to store non-structural crystal
data. These are subtypes of `Electrum.CrystalDataTrait` and include `Electrum.ByRealSpace{D}`,
`Electrum.ByReciprocalSpace{D}`, and `Electrum.ByAtom`, which correspond to data in D-dimensional
real space, data in D-dimensional reciprocal space, and data associated with individual atoms,
respectively.

To recover the data space trait, `DataSpace()` may be called with either the object or object type.
For custom types, this may be overloaded.

The `RealBasis{D}` and `ReciprocalBasis{D}` types return `ByRealSpace{D}()` and
`ByReciprocalSpace{D}()`, respectively. By default, types that have a defined `basis()` function
(or, by extension, a field `basis::Electrum.LatticeBasis`) will derive the trait from the return
type of `basis()`.

## `DataGrid`, `RealDataGrid`, and `ReciprocalDataGrid`

An `DataGrid{D,B<:Electrum.LatticeBasis,S<:AbstractVector{<:Real},T}` contains data defined in a
crystal lattice of `D` with basis vectors of type `B`, a shift parameter of type `S`, and elements
of type `T`, either in real space (`RealDataGrid`) or in reciprocal space (`ReciprocalDataGrid`).
These aliases are defined as follows:

```julia
const RealDataGrid{D,T} = DataGrid{D,RealBasis{D,Float64},SVector{D,Float64},T}
const ReciprocalDataGrid{D,T} = DataGrid{D,ReciprocalBasis{D,Float64},KPoint{D},T}
```
!!! note
    Look closely at the above definition: the shift data type for `RealDataGrid{D}` is
    `SVector{D,Float64}`, but the shift data type for `ReciprocalDataGrid{D}` is `KPoint{D}`. When
    the `DataGrid` constructor without the shift type parameter is invoked, the basis type is used
    to infer the appropriate shift type so that a `RealDataGrid` or `ReciprocalDataGrid` is
    constructed.

`DataGrid` uses zero-based, periodic indexing: the first index of an `AbstractDataGrid{D}` is
`zero(NTuple{D,Int})`, and indices whose moduli with respect to size along that dimension are
identical will reference the same element: for instance, for `g::AbstractDataGrid{3}` with size
`(10, 10, 10)`, `g[69, 420, 1337] === g[9, 0, 7]`. Encountering a `BoundsError` is not possible
when indexing an `DataGrid`.

The basis of an `DataGrid` can be recovered with `basis(::DataGrid)`, which will be of the type
specified by the type parameter. 

### Broadcasting and mathematical operations

Broadcasting is defined for `DataGrid` with a custom `Base.Broadcast.BroadcastStyle` subtype:
```julia
Electrum.DataGridStyle{D,B,S} <: Broadcast.AbstractArrayStyle{D}
```
This allows `DataGrid` instances to operated on with dot syntax. However, they must share lattice
basis vectors and shift values. If they do not match, an `Electrum.LatticeMismatch` exception will
be thrown.

!!! info
    Although `Base.Broadcast.ArrayStyle` is usually overridden by other subtypes of 
    `Base.Broadcast.AbstractArrayStyle`, it does not override `Electrum.DataGridStyle`. Adding a
    `DataGrid` to an `Array` returns an `Array`, and adding a `DataGrid` to other `AbstractArray`
    subtypes returns the `AbstractArray` subtype defined by the `Broadcast.BroadcastStyle`. In the 
    case of a dimension mismatch, the broadcast style wll be `Broadcast.ArrayConflict` - the
    operation will throw a `DimensionMismatch`.

The `+` and `-` operators are defined for `DataGrid` instances, and they are faster than the
broadcasted `.+` and `.-` equivalents. As with the broadcasted versions, checks are implemented to
ensure that the lattice basis vectors and shifts match.

Similarly, the `*`, `/`, and `\` operators are defined for pairs of `DataGrid` and `Number`
instances, and again, are faster than their broadcasted equivalents.

The Fourier transform and its inverse are available through an overload of `FFTW.fft()` and
`FFTW.ifft()`. The transforms are normalized with respect to the basis vectors of the space, so
for `g::DataGrid`, `ifft(fft(g)) â‰ˆ g` (to within floating point error).
