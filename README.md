# Xtal.jl

A Julia package for working with crystal structures and various associated file formats.

## Planned features

This project is just starting to get off the ground, but here's what we have planned:

 * Reading and writing of common crystal file formats:
     + XCrysDen XSF data files
     + VASP and ABINIT outputs
     + XYZ and XTL files
     + CIF files
 * Manipulation of data grids associated with crystal structures
     + Common elementwise mathematical operations on data grids
 * Generation of crystal structures
     + Support for building crystal symmetry using point group enforcement
     
...and more that we will decide in time!
